## Summary {.tabset}


In this task, I will be doing a time series analysis on adult fish passage from 2001 to 2011 at Willamette Falls fish ladder on the Willamette River, Oregon. In this document I will show a map of the fish ladder location, two time series analysis of adult passage for coho, jack coho, and steelhead salmon. Lastly, a graph will display the annual total counts of fish passage for the 3 selected species: coho, jack coho, and steelhead. 

```{r, out.width = "400px", fig.cap = "Climbing the Ladder stock photo. Tammy Fullum, istockphoto.com"}

```




```{r, out.width = "400px", fig.cap= "Fish Ladder Locations, CITE"}
knitr::include_graphics('fishladdermap.jpg')
```




  
### 2. Read in the Data 

```{r}
salmon <- read_csv(here('data/fish/willamette_fish_passage.csv'))


```



### 3.  Time Series Analysis

```{r}

### wrangle the data to create timeseries
salmon_ts <- salmon %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate_all(funs(ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))) %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% 
  as_tsibble(key = NULL,
             index = date)

salmon_ts_long <- salmon_ts %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(steelhead, coho, jack_coho),
               names_to = "fish",
               values_to = "count") %>% 
   mutate(fish = case_when(
    fish == 'jack_coho' ~ "Jack Coho",
    fish == 'coho' ~ "Coho",
    fish == 'steelhead' ~ "Steelhead"
  ))

### create the actual plot

ggplot(data = salmon_ts_long,
       aes(x = date,
           y = count)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = fish)) +
  labs(x = 'Date',
       y = 'Amount of Fish',
       caption = "CAPTION HERE",
       title = "Willamette Falls Fish \n Ladder use by Salmon Species")

```

#### 3.1 Analysis Conclusions
  - Steelhead are the most consistent users of the fish ladder
  - Coho had the largest ladder us in 2010
  - Jack Coho species is the most infrequent user of the fish ladder, or the data had a hard time capturing their usage.


### 4.  Seasonal Analysis

```{r}
### create a finalized seasonplot for each species in its own panel (patchwork)

#steelhead_season <- salmon_ts %>% 
 # gg_season(y = steelhead,
  #          pal = viridis(10),
   #         show.legend = FALSE)

# coho_season <- salmon_ts %>% 
 # gg_season(y = coho,
    #        pal = viridis(10),
     #       show.legend = FALSE)

# jack_coho_season <- salmon_ts %>% 
  # gg_season(y = jack_coho,
        #    pal = viridis(10)) 



salmon_ts_long %>% 
  gg_season(y = count,
            pal = magma(10)) +
  labs(y = "Amount of Fish",
       x = "Month",
       color = 'Year',
       title = "Salmon Ladder Use by Season",
       caption = "PUT CAPTION HERE (CITATION)")
```

#### 4.1 Analysis Conclusions
  - Steelhead salmon use the fish ladder more from January - July than August - December.
  - Both Jack Coho and Coho only use the ladder in the fall months, specifically around October.
  - None of the 3 salmon species use the ladder frequently during November and December. 



### 5. Annual Species Count

```{r}

salmon_ts_year <- 
  salmon %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate_all(funs(ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))) %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date),
         year = year(date)) %>% 
    pivot_longer(c(steelhead, coho, jack_coho),
               names_to = "fish",
               values_to = "count") %>% 
  group_by(year, fish) %>% 
  summarize(yearly_count = sum(count))

ggplot(data = salmon_ts_year, aes(x = year, y = yearly_count)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = fish)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('purple4', 'blue', 'salmon')) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009)) +
  labs(title = "Annual Counts of Salmon Species",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Amount of Species",
       fill = "Salmon Species",
       caption = "Figure 3. Annual amount of salmon species to use 
       the fish ladder in XX (CITATION HERE).")
