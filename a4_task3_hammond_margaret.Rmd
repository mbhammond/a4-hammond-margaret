## Overview {.tabset}
In this task, I will be doing a text analysis on Lana Del Rey's breakout album, *Born to Die*. This 2012 album became a breakout pop sensation, and is known as a depressing, sensual, teen-angst love-laced album. I will be organizing the lyrics by track number, and doing an afinn analysis to see how positive or negative the lyrics are ranked. 



### Get Born to Die - the Album Data Wrangling

```{r}
lana_album <- pdf_text(here('data/pdf_analysis/lana-del-rey-born-to-die-lyrics.pdf'))

# Seperating the lines of music 

lana_lines <- data.frame(lana_album) %>% 
  mutate(page = 1:n()) %>% 
  mutate(full_text = str_split(lana_album,
                               pattern = '\\n')) %>% 
  unnest(full_text) %>% 
  mutate(full_text = str_squish(full_text))

```

#### Music Tidying

```{r}
lana_songs <- lana_lines %>% 
  mutate(song = ifelse(str_detect(full_text, "Song"),
          full_text,
          NA)) %>% 
  fill(song, .direction = 'down') %>% 
  separate(col = song, into = c('song', 'no'),
           sep = " ") %>% 
  mutate(song = as.numeric(as.roman(no))) %>% 
  mutate(no = as.numeric(as.roman(no))) %>% 
  mutate(song = case_when(
    song == '1' ~ 'Born To Die',
    song == '2' ~ 'Off To The Races',
    song == '3' ~ 'Blue Jeans',
    song == '4' ~ 'Video Games',
    song == '5' ~ 'Diet Mountain Dew',
    song == '6' ~ 'National Anthem',
    song == '7' ~ 'Dark Paradise',
    song == '8' ~ 'Radio',
    song == '9' ~ 'Carmen',
    song == '10' ~ 'Million Dollar Man',
    song == '11' ~ 'Summertime Sadness',
    song == '12' ~ 'This Is What \n Makes Us Girls',
    song == '13' ~ 'Without You',
    song == '14' ~ 'Lolita',
    song == '15' ~ 'Lucky Ones',
    song == '16' ~ 'Ride',
    song == '17' ~ 'Blue Velvet'
  )) 


#mutate(fish = case_when(
 #   fish == 'jack_coho' ~ "Jack Coho",
  #  fish == 'coho' ~ "Coho",
   # fish == 'steelhead' ~ "Steelhead"
 # ))
```


#### Word count by Song

```{r}
lana_song_words <- lana_songs %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, full_text, token = "words") %>% 
  select(-lana_album)

lana_wordcount <- lana_song_words %>% 
  count(song, no, word) 

x <- stop_words

lana_words_clean <- lana_song_words %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words, by = 'word')

lana_nonstop_counts <- lana_words_clean %>% 
  count(song, no, word)
```

### Find top 5 words for each song

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
top_5_words <- lana_nonstop_counts %>% 
  group_by(song) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(song = fct_reorder(song, no))

ggplot(data = top_5_words) +
  geom_col(aes(x = n,
               y = word),
           fill = "pink2") +
  facet_wrap( ~song, 
               scales = 'free') +
  labs(x = "Lyric",
       y = "Amount Used",
       title = "Most Common Words in Born to Die, Lana Del Rey",
       caption = "CAPTION HERE") +
  theme(panel.spacing.x = unit(1, "lines"),
                         panel.spacing.y = unit(1, "lines")) +
  theme_minimal()


```

### Sentiment Analysis

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
lana_afinn <- lana_words_clean %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments('afinn'),
             by = 'word') %>% 
    mutate(song = fct_reorder(song, no))

#lana_afinn_counts <- lana_afinn %>% 
 # count(song, value)

lana_afinn_means <- lana_afinn %>% 
  group_by(song) %>% 
  summarize(mean_affin = mean(value))

ggplot(data = lana_afinn_means,
       aes(x = fct_rev(factor(song)),
           y = mean_affin)) +
  geom_col(fill = "pink2") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Mean Afinn Value",
       x = "Track Title",
       title = "Afinn Value for Born to Die by Lana del Rey",
       caption = "Average Afinn value for each track on Born to Die, Lana del Rey's breakout 2012 album.") +
  theme_minimal()


lana_nrc <- lana_words_clean %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments('nrc')) 

lana_nrc_counts <- lana_nrc %>% 
  count(no, song, sentiment) %>% 
  mutate(song = fct_reorder(song, no))

ggplot(data = lana_nrc_counts,
       aes(x = sentiment, 
           y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = 'pink2') +
  facet_wrap( ~song, scales = "fixed") +
  labs(x = "Amount of NRC Words found",
       y = "NRC Sentiment",
       title = "NRC Sentiment Analysis of Born to Die",
       caption = "NRC Sentiment analysis of the lyrics in each track from Born to Die by Lana Del Rey (2012).") +
  coord_flip() +
 #   theme(panel.spacing.x = unit(1, "lines"),
 #                        panel.spacing.y = unit(1, "lines")) +
  theme_minimal()
```
### Data Conclusion

Import text of your choosing (from a PDF, text file, or otherwise) - I encourage you to find some text that is of interest to you, but some suggestions for places to look are listed below this task. You can also import two text files if you want to do a comparison of most frequent words or sentiment analysis. 
Wrangle the data to get tokens into tidy format, removing stop words
Find and make a finalized visualization of counts for the most frequently used words in the text (this can be split up by chapter / section for comparison, or for the entire document), for example in a column graph or wordcloud, or both.
Perform sentiment analysis using one of the lexicons introduced in Lab Week 9 (your choice), and present in a final visualization. 
Include an overview section that briefly summarizes the dataset and your analysis.  This should as always include a well formatted data citation.
